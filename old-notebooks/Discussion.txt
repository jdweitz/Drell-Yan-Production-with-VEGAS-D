Notes and discussion on the Drell-Yan process, standard acceptance-rejection MC method, VECAS MC method, etc.

- Drell-Yan process, in general
    - hadron-hadron scattering
    - quark of one hadron and an antiquark of another hadron annihilate
        - creating a virtual photon or Z boson
               - which then decays into a pair of oppositely-charged leptons
    - Key component: the energy of the colliding quark-antiquark pair can be nearly completely
    
- Other processes
    - Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS)
    - Electroweak Boson Production, @ CMS
    - Higgs Boson Production via Gluon Fusion @ CMS
    - Pair Production in e+e- Colliders
    
- The Drell-Yan process we are considering
    - electron and positron collide to produce a virtual photon or a Z boson that decays into a muon-antimuon pair

- Cross Section
    - differential scattering cross section, usually depends on the scattering angle, theta
    - total cross section from integral over solid angle
    - considered the probability for a given process to occur
    - cross section measured in barns, 1 barn = 10^-28 m^2
    
Number of interactions = cross section * flux * number of target particles per unit volume * thickness of target

    - So intuitively, larger cross section ~ greater probability
    
- Fermi's Golden Rule, for scattering
    - Variables: amplitude and phase space
